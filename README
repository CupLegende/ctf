Documentation on the using/building/running and the internal software of the CTF library is available on the following website
http://ctf.cs.berkeley.edu

Brief build instructions below:

To build CTF with a standard setup simply run make in the top directory.

To specialize the build configuration (for instance set a custom BLAS library
or specify MPI compiler), one must set up a config.mk file. Examples and 
premade config.mk files for a few architectures are located in the 
mkfiles/ subdirectory. On running make without a config.mk file in the top
folder, mkfiles/config.mk.linux will be copied to config.mk in the top folder by default,
unless the hostname is recognized. Apple machines should also be recognized automatically,
but this is not currently well-tested. The config.mk file will not be overwritten
after the first call to 'make'. The first call to 'make' will create the 
file src/make/make.in, which records the top level directory. So, if you desire to move
the built source code, change or delete and recreate this file by running make again.

The CTF library is built by default and will be located in lib/. The main 
interface to the library is include/ctf.hpp.

Run 'make examples' to build example programs, see examples/ dir for full list
(any one of them can be built individually by the command 'make <example_name>'. 
Any executables that are build will appear in bin/

The license corresponding to the code in this library is in the file license.txt.

This is not an official release and we provide no guarantees on correctness
or speed of the code. Please contact Edgar Solomonik (solomon@cs.berkeley.edu),
for any questions about usage or technical implementation of the CTF library.
